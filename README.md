This project will examine climate data from the Copernicus API "Global Land Surface Atmospheric Variables from 1755 to 2020". 
It will analyze temperature change differences between rural and urban environments,as well as extreme wind and rainfall changes. 
The dataset will contain hundreds of millions of rows due to the API having records from 75,247 weather stations.
A machine learning model will be created to detect the type of terrain at various locations from satellite images
